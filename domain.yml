  #  - text: "I’m really glad you’re open to trying something. 💙
   #     Here’s one grounding technique you can try right now:
   ##
    #    • Look around and name 5 things you can see
    #    • 4 things you can touch
    #    • 3 things you can hear
    ##    • 2 things you can smell
     #   • 1 thing you can taste

      #  This can help slow down overwhelming thoughts.
      #  Would you like me to suggest another small calming activity?"
    #- text: "You’re taking a positive step by trying this. 💙
    #    Try the **deep breathing exercise**:
    #
    #    • Inhale slowly through your nose for 4 seconds
     #   • Hold your breath for 4 seconds
      #  • Exhale gently through your mouth for 6 seconds
       # • Repeat 5 times
#
 #       This can reduce immediate stress.
  #      Would you like another calming idea?"
   # - text: "That’s a brave choice. 💙
    #    Try this **5‑minute self‑soothing exercise**:
     #
      #  • Place your hand on your heart
       # • Take slow breaths
        #• Silently repeat: “I am safe. This feeling will pass.”  #

       # This helps your nervous system calm down.
       # Want me to share another small exercise?"

    #- text: "I’m here with you. 💙
    #    Sometimes a **sensory reset** can help:
        
     #   • Splash cool water on your face
     #   • Rub your hands together to warm them
     #   • Press your feet firmly into the floor and notice the ground supporting you

      #  This can help anchor you in the present moment.
      #  Would you like another technique?"
